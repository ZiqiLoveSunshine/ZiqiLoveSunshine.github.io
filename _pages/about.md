## Academic

I am currently a PhD student supervised by [Sao Mai NGUYEN](http://nguyensmai.free.fr/Home.html) and [Philippe XU](https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~philippe.xu/) in [U2IS](http://u2is.ensta-paris.fr/?lang=en), [ENSTA](https://www.ensta-paris.fr/), [IP-Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/). My research interest is about reinforcement learning and robotics.

- Active Imitation learning on robotics.
  
- Reinforcement learning based manipulation for robot arms.

- Long-horizon robot task.

- Human robot interaction.

<!-- ## Teaching

In 2023, I have been doing a teaching assistant in SPEIT SJTU. My work is about help the professor teach undergraduate students in mobile robotic classes.

## Exchange

From 08/2021 to 09/2022, being proficient in French, I have been to ENSTA Paris for over one year as a exchange graduate student. In ENSTA, I took some courses of domain Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies and participated in the [U2IS Lab](http://u2is.ensta-paris.fr/index.php?lang=en) and was mentored by [Sao Mai NGUYEN](http://nguyensmai.free.fr/Home.html).I have developed a good acknowledgement about human robot interaction and have done some researches on motion retargeting.

## Internship
In 2020, I developped a three month internship in the company Air Liquide, there, I worked for the computer science department and tried to solve a distribution problem by using the clustering algorithm.

In 2023, I developed a 4 monthâ€™s internship in the company ABB. The company wants to explore the behaviour of dual-arm robot YuMi in the domain of sign-language demonstration. When a person says a word, the robot YuMi can translate this information into sign-language. In order to achieving this goal, we separate the work into partitions. First part is the convert of human language to human sign-language, this is done by an application developed by HUAWEI. In the second part, what we need to do is converting the movement of human-being to dual-arm robots, this problem is also belongs to motion-retargeting domain. In our work, we read the article on different ways of motion retargeting, make a resume on their advantages and inconvenience. Then, we successfully practice the most effective way of human-robot retargeting method on our own dataset collected by HUAWEI application and a dual-arm robot YuMi equipped with Schunk hand. We analyze the results and conclude what we should in the future. -->
